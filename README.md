GoldStandards
=============

Each GS file is serialized in a TSV (tab separated value file) format.

The GS lists the cross language relations held by the surface forms 
(generally variables or literals shared between couple of files).

The GS is structured as follows:
- src file name
- row number in which the surface form is spotted in the original project
- column number in which the surface form is spotted in the original project. 
  '\t' is considered as 4 white spaces
- destination file name
- row number in which the surface form is spotted in the original project
- column number in which the surface form is spotted in the original project. 
  '\t' is considered as 4 white spaces
